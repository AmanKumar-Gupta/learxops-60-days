Create a group called `devops_team` and add `devops_user` to that group.

**Answer:**
```sh
sudo groupadd devops_team
sudo usermod -aG devops_team devops_user
```

Verify using the command:
```sh
groups devops_user
```

**Explanation:**

- `sudo groupadd devops_team`  
    Creates a new group named `devops_team`.

- `sudo usermod -aG devops_team devops_user`  
    Adds `devops_user` to the `devops_team` group.  
    `-aG` appends (`-a`) the user to the specified group (`-G devops_team`) without removing them from other groups.
