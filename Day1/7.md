# Find Most Frequently Used Shell Command

Write a one-liner command to find the most frequently used command in your shell history.

```bash
history | awk '{CMD[$2]++;} END {for (a in CMD) print CMD[a], a;}' | sort -nr | head -1
```

### Explanation:

- `history` → Lists the command history.
- `awk '{CMD[$2]++;} END {for (a in CMD) print CMD[a], a;}'`
    - Extracts and counts occurrences of each command.
- `sort -nr` → Sorts the commands by frequency in descending order.
- `head -1` → Displays the most frequently used command.
